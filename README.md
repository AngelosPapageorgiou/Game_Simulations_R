Repository Owner: [Angelos Papageorgiou] | Statistics Student @ AUEB (Athens University of Economics and Business)

This repository contains R-based simulations and exercises from my university courses, focusing on:

Probability & Statistics: Simulations of games (dice, cards, etc.) to demonstrate statistical concepts.

Game Theory: Strategic interactions (Nash equilibrium, auctions, Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma).

Stochastic Processes: Markov chains, random walks, and Monte Carlo methods.

Data Visualization: Using ggplot2, plotly, or Shiny apps to analyze outcomes.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Practice and document my coursework in R programming and statistical modeling.

Share reusable code for fellow students or educators.

Visualize theoretical concepts through interactive examples.
